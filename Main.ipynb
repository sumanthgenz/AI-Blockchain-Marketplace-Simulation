The various parties in this simulation are 3 streaming providers: Netflix, Hulu and Prime. All 3 providers share the same 100 films in their streaming library. Each provider has a varying amount of customers that subscribe to its streaming service. A provider selects 10 movies a week for each consumer, of which consumers can buy any number of movies based on their own internal criteria. Purchases made by consumers for the week is formatted as data and is placed on a simple blockchain. All providers have access to at least their own customer data on the blockchain. By importing consumer data from the blockchain, each provider can train its own machine learning model to better predict and recommend films for consumers the next week. The goal of each provider is to maximize profit by recommending what it believes to the best-matches to each consumer and receiving high engagement from consumers as a result. \n","\n","Scroll down to get started!\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7Q6NLOcQy_RR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Audience\n","The audience class represents an individual consumer.
